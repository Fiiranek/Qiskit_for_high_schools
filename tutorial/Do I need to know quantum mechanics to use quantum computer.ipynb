In the following task, we will use two algorithms: **Shor's** and **Grover's**. Thanks to the library, we do not have to go into detail about each of them, because their operation is quite complicated. We will briefly discuss their operation as their construction will be discussed in the next part of the project."

It is divided into a classical and a quantum part. At present, for numbers with low values, it is more profitable to use a classical computer. However, in the case of huge numbers, this algorithm is the most optimal solution. The practical application of this algorithm is breaking cyphers."
